AN AI DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO DETECT FAKE NOTES
💵 README: Currency Note Detection ModelThis README provides a comprehensive description and guide for the Currency Note Detection Model.1. Project Description and Goal 🎯The Currency Note Detection Model is a specialized object detection system designed to automatically identify, locate, and classify different denominations and types of currency notes (banknotes) in images or real-time video streams.Key Objectives:Authentication: Help verify the presence of valid currency notes.Classification: Accurately determine the denomination (e.g., $1, $5, ₹10, ₹100) and the issuing country/series of the detected note.Location: Output precise bounding boxes around each detected note, even when notes are partially overlapping or crumpled.Core Technology:This model leverages advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures (such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN) trained on a large, diverse dataset of currency notes under various conditions (lighting, angle, partial occlusion).2. Prerequisites and Installation 💻To set up and run the model, you will need the following environment.Required Dependencies:Python: Version 3.8+Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (depending on the specific model implementation).Supporting Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.Installation Steps:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd currency-detection-model
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Download Model Weights:The pre-trained weights file (best_currency_detector.pt or similar) must be downloaded and placed in the designated weights/ directory. (Instructions for download will be provided separately, as these files are large.)3. Usage Guide 🚀The primary function of this project is running inference to detect currency notes.3.1. Running Inference (Detection)Use the detect.py script to process images or videos.Input Data: The model accepts single image files, a directory of images, or video files (.mp4, .avi).Command Syntax:Bashpython detect.py --weights weights/best_currency_detector.pt --source [INPUT_PATH] --conf 0.7
Key Arguments:--weights: Path to the trained model weight file.--source: Path to the image, folder, or video you want to analyze.--conf: Confidence Threshold. Only detections with a score above this value will be displayed (default: 0.7).--save-dir: Directory where annotated output images/videos will be saved (default: runs/detect/currency/).3.2. Output FormatFor each detected note, the model outputs:Bounding Box Coordinates: $(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2)$ defining the location of the note.Class Label: The identified denomination (e.g., USD_20, INR_500, EUR_5).Confidence Score ($P$): A value between $0$ and $1$ indicating the model's certainty.The output images will have the bounding box and label drawn directly on them.4.
