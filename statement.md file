# Project Statement - Fake Currency Detection Using Deep Learning

## Problem Statement

Counterfeit currency continues to be a real-world problem that affects everyday people, businesses, and banks. Identifying fake notes manually is not always reliable, and it requires trained experts and special equipment. In many situations, people make mistakes because fake notes can appear very similar to real ones. To solve this issue, this project aims to create an automated system that can check a currency note using just an image and accurately determine whether it is real or fake using deep learning.

## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a simple and smart deep learning model that can analyze an uploaded picture of a currency note and decide if it is genuine or counterfeit. The system will include data preparation, preprocessing, model training, testing, and final prediction. The model can be used in real-life environments like shops or banks where fast decisions are needed, and it can later be expanded to support multiple currencies and mobile deployment.

## Target Users

* Banks and financial institutions that handle large amounts of cash every day
* Retail shops and businesses that frequently receive cash payments
* ATM and cash-counting machine manufacturers
* Police and legal authorities involved in fraud detection
* Anyone who wants a quick tool to verify currency authenticity

## High-Level Features

* Users can upload a currency note image to check authenticity
* The system uses deep learning to study patterns and decide real vs fake
* Fast output with prediction confidence score
* Works in real-time and can be deployed on different devices
* Scalable and can be improved for different countries and currencies
