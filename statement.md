# Fake Currency Detection Using Deep Learning – Statement File

## Problem Statement

Fake currency circulation has become a serious problem that affects everyday people, businesses, and financial systems. Manually checking currency is slow, stressful, and not always accurate, especially because modern counterfeit notes can look very similar to real ones. Many people do not have access to verification machines or expert knowledge, which increases the chances of financial loss. This project aims to build an automated system that can check a currency note simply from an image and accurately identify whether it is genuine or counterfeit using deep learning.

## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is to develop a deep learning model that analyzes currency note images and makes an authenticity prediction. It includes collecting a dataset, preprocessing images, training a classification model, evaluating results, and generating a real-time prediction output. The model will be designed to work efficiently on different devices and can later be extended to support multiple currency types and real deployment in banks, shops, and mobile applications.

## Target Users

* Banks, ATMs, and cash-handling organizations
* Retail and commercial businesses
* Police, forensic, and fraud investigation units
* Currency counting machine manufacturers
* Individuals wanting to verify currency quickly and safely

## High-Level Features

* Upload an image of a currency note for verification
* Automated deep-learning-based prediction: Genuine or Counterfeit
* Confidence score for each prediction
* Fast processing suitable for real-time checking
* Scalable system that can be expanded to multiple currencies and mobile devices
